// Navigation history for AID jumps — the "go back to where I came from" stack.
//
// PTT itself has NO notion of a jump origin: mbbsd/read.c#select_by_aid only
// moves the cursor inside currboard and a cross-board jump is a real board
// switch (mbbsd/read.c:367, and see docs/pttbbs-screen-protocol.md §8.1). So
// "back" can only be a SECOND navigation, replayed from a description of where
// we were. That is exactly what BePTT does (a global stack of key sequences,
// replayed on the Android back press); the difference here is that the replay
// runs through CommandQueue with a per-step expect instead of being sent blind.
//
// What an entry stores is therefore an ANCHOR — how to get back — never any
// screen data:
//   kind 'aid'   #<aid> is the server-side identity of an article: immune to
//                deletions shifting numbers AND to a `/` search having renumbered
//                the list (MODE_SELECT is a separate numbering space —
//                mbbsd/read.c:661-665). Two sources: the article was ITSELF
//                reached by an AID jump (NavHistory.landed()), or — the normal
//                case — aid_navigation asked the server for it with the Q
//                post-info box before leaving (upgradePendingOriginAid).
//   kind 'num'   board + article number + subject. Covers the common "opened
//                from the list" case. Numbers DO shift when posts are deleted,
//                so the landing must be verified against `subject` before the
//                article is opened (aid_navigation._enqueueNumberJump).
//   kind 'board' board only: replay `s<board>` and stop on the list. pttbbs
//                keeps a per-board cursor (getkeep, mbbsd/read.c:105/1171 — an
//                unbounded link block, never evicted within a session), so the
//                cursor is still parked on the article we left. Deliberately
//                NOT auto-opened: unlike the other two kinds nothing here
//                identifies the article, so we hand the last keypress back to
//                the user.
//
// The begin/commit split is the whole safety story: a run that fails NEVER
// pushes and NEVER pops. Any failure, or any navigation we did not drive
// (the user pressing ← back to the list, a board switch, a disconnect), clears
// the WHOLE stack — a stale anchor would send the user somewhere wrong, which
// is far worse than losing the ability to go back.

// Anchor for "the article we are leaving right now", picked by priority.
// Pure function: everything it needs is passed in, so it is unit-testable
// without any of the live objects.
