// Click-to-navigate for PTT article-code (AID) links in easy reading.
//
// Clicking a "#1gIeu-3A" link (detected by aid_parse.js, rendered by
// Row/LinkSegmentBuilder) drives the native key sequence a user would type:
//   s <board> ⏎   (board jump — works from INSIDE the article too, so no
//                  leave-article step is needed; always taken, even for the
//                  same board: one code path, and the s-search is forgiving)
//   # <aid> ⏎     (AID search — cursor lands on the target row)
//   ⏎             (open the article)
//
// …but ONLY when the pager is in currstat == READING. mbbsd/more.c:102-112 gates
// both s (RET_SELECTBRD) and # (RET_SELECTAID) on it, so inside a 站內信
// (currstat == RMAIL) they are DONOTHING and "s<board>\r" gets eaten KEY BY KEY
// as pager hotkeys instead (Y=回信給所有人, X/%=推文, T=改標題, E=編輯…) — a
// misfire, not just a no-op (回報實錄 ptt-debug-20260813: 畫面直接跳到另一封信).
// So the sequence is preceded by an ESCAPE preamble whenever the footer does not
// prove READING (parsePagerFooterContext, single-directional — see string_util):
//   ← × n         (back out one level per press until 【主功能表】)
// 主功能表 is the only safe place to resume from: mbbsd/menu.c:498 routes s in
// MMENU/TMENU/XMENU to ReadSelect() → do_select() → a real board entry, whereas
// mbbsd/board.c:1902's s (看板列表/我的最愛/分類看板) is a SEARCH that only moves
// the cursor. The price is that ReadSelect() calls Read(), which shows the board's
// 進板畫面 + pressanykey on this session's first entry (mbbsd/bbs.c:4482-4492) —
// the in-article path never does (more.c:177 calls Select() alone) — so the
// via-menu board jump also dismisses those. See _enqueueBoardJump.
// Each step is a serialized CommandQueue command completed by CONTENT (an
// expect over the settle facts), exactly like list_session's transactions.
// While the sequence runs, user input is blocked (`active` is checked at the
// term_view/pttchrome input entry points) and the REAL native screen is
// mirrored live: the article easy reading enters functionMode, and an engaged
// list session is parked in its own functionMode via beginExternalNavigation()
// so its reducer stays out of the way (clean-list settles stay; the final
// article settle takes the normal handoff).
//
// Failures are visible, never silently retried (v5 convention): any step's
// onFail unlocks input, flashes a banner and leaves the native screen as-is —
// the easy-reading/list state machines self-converge from whatever shows.

// Going BACK (the same machinery in reverse)
// ------------------------------------------
// PTT keeps no jump origin, so "back" is a SECOND navigation replayed from an
// anchor captured before we left — exactly BePTT's design (a stack of key
// sequences, replayed on the back press), except every step is verified by
// content here instead of being sent blind. The stack lives in nav_history.js;
// the only difference between a forward jump and a back run is the middle step
// (_enqueueMiddle): #<aid>, <num> or nothing at all.
//
// The capture ORDER is an invariant: the anchor must be read BEFORE
// _enterFunctionMode() / beginExternalNavigation(), because the latter clears
// list_session's _boardName/_serverNum (list_session.js#_enterFunctionMode).
//
// A num anchor is verified against the landing row's subject before ⏎ goes
// out: article numbers shift when posts are deleted, and opening the WRONG
// article is far worse than stopping on the list.
